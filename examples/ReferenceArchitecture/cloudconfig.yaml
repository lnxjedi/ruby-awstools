## Library tags - TODO: Implement
# ruby-awstools makes use of AWS Tags for tracking and resolving assets.
# To avoid conflicts, it's possible to set what tag names are used and
# managed by the library. Note that the contents of these tags are
# generated from the 'name' parameter and the configured DNSDomain and
# DNSBase - even when integrated DNS isn't used.
# The ScopedName is <hostname>.<scope>, e.g. web1.accounting. When "Name"
# is used, the library name will be the same as the AWS Name.
ScopedName: Name
# The full scope is used by the library to identify all assets managed
# by When using
# library integrated Route53 DNS updates, the library will create A
FullScope: Domain
## CloudFormation configuration items
# S3 bucket where library resources such as CloudFormation templates will be
# stored, for parent/child stacks.
#Bucket: my.cloudformation.bucket
# S3 prefix for the templates, templates will go in
# s3://<bucket>/<prefix>/<stackname>/<template>
#Prefix: prodstacks
# All CloudFormation stacks created by this repository will be named
# <StackFamily>-<stackname>, and all CloudFormation variable lookups
#StackFamily: ProdEnv
# CIDRLists are treated specially; when referenced in a template
# using $$ {listname}, they will be intelligently expanded depending
# on the type of resource being defined, and may duplicate the resource or
# add items to an array.
# Required CIDR list for creating Bastion Security Group
#CIDRLists:
#  BastionCIDRs:
#  - 1.1.0.0/16
#  - 2.2.0.0/16
# VPC CIDR, encompassing the entirety of the cloud network; this should
# probably be a class-B network from somewhere in RFC 1918
#MgmtCIDR: 10.42.0.0/22
#MgmtDMZACIDR: 10.42.0.1/24
#MgmtDMZBCIDR: 10.42.0.2/24

## EC2 / RDS / Route53 config items. Library methods will automatically
# create or remove DNS records when items are created / destroyed / started
# / stopped.
# Base of hosted zone, normally the parent domain in a heirarchical collection
# of sites. This should generally be set in a common repository, and child
# repositories will inherit this value by adding the common repository in
# it's SearchPath.
#DNSBase: mycompany.com
# Resources created with this repository will get DNS records
# of the form <name>.prod.mycompany.com, and will get a ScopedName
# of <name>.prod.
#DNSDomain: prod.mycompany.com
# The route53 tool needs zone IDs; these are normally the CloudFormation
# addresses of the required public & private zone IDs.
#PrivateDNSId: ${=dnsstack:PrivateZone}
#PublicDNSId: ${=dnsstack:PublicZone}
# SimpleDB domain for storing configuration type data, e.g.
# ${ami:c7stdcis}. Value for DefaultSDB is required to resolve $ {%...}
# references.
# TTL to use when creating A records
#ARecTTL: 300
#CNAMERecTTL: 600
#TXTRecTTL: 120
# Not all availability zones are available for a given account, so check
# first with 'aws ec2 describe-availability-zones', then list the ones
# you want to use here.
#AvailabilityZones: [ "a", "b", "c", "d" ]

## SimpleDB
# Ephemeral values like AMI IDs can be stored in a SimpleDB domain and
# retrieved in templates with the ${%...} syntax.
# If you use these defaults, you can just 'cfn create sdbcfg'
#ConfigDB: ${=ConfigDB:ConfigDBDomain}
#DefaultSDB: ConfigDB
