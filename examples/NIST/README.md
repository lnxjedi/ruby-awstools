# NIST Templates

The templates in this example were derived from the AWS [NIST quickstart](https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/accelerator-nist/) templates, with the following modifications:

 * Broken up in to multiple stacks that can be launched and updated independently
 * Added a low-cost Autoscaling nat instance option
